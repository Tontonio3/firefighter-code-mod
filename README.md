# Firefighter Robot Code

In our grade twelve Computer Engineering class, we were tasked with building a firefighter robot. The robot's capabilities were to navigate a maze, avoiding obstacles in it such as pits, and to ultimately locate a candle-lit flame and extinguish it. The bot was controlled using a PIC16F18875 microcontroller, which was programmed with Great Cow Basic as the language, and MELab's mePROG software to program the chip.

This version of the code is incomplete; it has the subroutines we developed, but is missing the integral main functions that utilized them.
